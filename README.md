Greetings my Hacker Friends,
I am currently a Ph.D student at the University of South Alabama. While that school is not very well known, the curriculum is a kick in the balls. My advisor tries very hard to help my crappy ass to the finish line. I am very appreciative of his endeavors as he crams knowledge in my good-for-nothing brain.
