Greetings my Hacker Friends,
I am currently a Ph.D student at the University of South Alabama. While that school is not very well known, the curriculum is a kick in the balls. My advisor tries very hard to help my crappy ass to the finish line. I am very appreciative of his endeavors as he crams knowledge in my good-for-nothing brain.

Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. I am so in touch with badgelife. It is a cult following of people that enjoy the indie badges that are made each year for DEFCON. I hate to admit it, but I drop an unGodly amount of $$$ on it each year. I will probably walk away with 20 or so badges (not counting the official one) from the con this year.
