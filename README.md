Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. I am so in touch with badgelife. It is a cult following of people that enjoy the indie badges that are made each year for DEFCON. I hate to admit it, but I drop an unGodly amount of $$$ on it each year. I will probably walk away with 20 or so badges (not counting the official one) from the con this year.
